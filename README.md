### Approach Taken

- Did up the grid and using border-radius to form a cirlce target.

- Next, by using random number generator to select which circle to turn red.

- Adding eventlistener to all the circles. All the Eventlisteners here are to check which target the player clicked. It will display the next target if the player clicked the red circle.

- By now, the game can be played and the player can practice his shooting indefinitely . Next on, added Timer count down for the game to start and Timer for the game to end. Timers are set up using setInterval, setTimeout.

- Added Start, Stop, Restart buttons to go along with the timers.

- Added adding points for clicking the red target. Added display for timer and scoreboard at the side.

- Added blanket to cover the board to display counter timer for the game to start and end game score board.

- Added new mode, Friendly fire. Green targets will appear when friendly fire is on. You will lose immediately if you shot a friendly unit.

- Added sound to every click for more immersive experience.

## Future Plans
